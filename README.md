the file is completely parametric, i had to change the position of the rails, and a bunch of files, any question just ask, i intend to build this printer, so any feedback will be greatly appreciate, it's still some small stuff missing, but for a complete working printer, it should have all files necessary for the modification. 

files that i had to change z belt drive, z idler, z bearing block, zbearing block top, and z bearing block bottom became one, front idler top, front idler bottom, a/b driver, z chain lower mount, panel clip, and door clips. 

i believe the profile i have is the 4040 series 10, but i am not sure. 

i also changed the mgn9 on z to mgn12. i will build the first one as a 350x350, as i don't want to risk a 500x500 with a carriage with 2020, i believe everything else can be used from the original project from voron 2.4.R2

Update: 7 of april of 2024, there are some problems on the build volume and joints on the file, i am fixing it, i will release the fixed files in a few days, will add offset to add in top of the build volume that way you can add freee gantry movement without adding bed, also will add the full height, full width and full depth, also adding caster height to have full height better calculated.

update: 8 of april of 2024, several fixes, fixed all types of joints added some joint animations, i will add a video later on about it, fixed door clips, fixed build volume, put a image of parameter to make it easier to change and understand, added full height, full width, full depth, added build_x_y_z_offset.

update: 15 of april of 2024, a few more joints fixed, this fix are about the size of the gantry profiles, as they do have some work around on then i put up to 6 mm more or less. but you should not change more than 3 mm. if you do want to change change on gantry_x_front, gantry_x_back or gantry_y
also changed the sizes of gantry and overral so all gantrys were on good sizes to be cut, on older one you would find sizes like 572 mm or 673, now i changed so it has easy to cut sizes ending in 0 or 5, ie. 570,475 and so on. 
also changed build_x_offset to 47 mm, build_y_offset to 50 mm and build_z_offset to 24 mm, also i will add my first buy list.
