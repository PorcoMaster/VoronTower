# Voron Tower
A 4040 frame voron, with the possibility of a box and feet.
Biggest file cannot be uploaded on github, it's on this drive

the file is completely parametric, i had to change the position of the rails, and a bunch of files, any question just ask, i intend to build this printer, so any feedback will be greatly appreciate, it's still some small stuff missing, but for a complete working printer, it should have all files necessary for the modification. 

files that i had to change z belt drive, z idler, z bearing block, zbearing block top, and z bearing block bottom became one, front idler top, front idler bottom, a/b driver, z chain lower mount, panel clip, and door clips. 

i believe the profile i have is the 4040 series 10, but i am not sure. 

i also changed the mgn9 on z to mgn12. i will build the first one as a 350x350, as i don't want to risk a 500x500 with a carriage with 2020, i believe everything else can be used from the original project from voron 2.4.R2
